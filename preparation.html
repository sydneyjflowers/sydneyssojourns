                    Research Your Destination:
                    <ul>
                   <li> Start by thoroughly researching your destination. Learn about its culture, customs, language, laws, and major attractions. Understanding the place you're visiting will enhance your trip greatly.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    Create a Travel Itinerary:
                    <ul>
                   <li> Plan your trip schedule, including the places you want to visit, activities you want to do, and a rough agenda. Make sure to make reservations early if necessary. Having a plan can help you make the most of your time and ensure you don't miss out on must-see attractions.</li>
                   </ul>
                   
                    Budget:
                    <ul>
                   <li> Determine a travel budget that includes transportation, housing, food, activities, and emergency funds. Stick to your budget to avoid overspending and financial stress during your trip. This is especially important as a college student!</li>
                   </ul>
                    Pack Wisely:
                    <ul>
                   <li> Pack according to the weather and activities you have planned. Make a packing list to ensure you don't forget essential items like travel documents, medications, technological devices, and travel adapters if necessary. Reference the master packing list below!</li>
                   </ul>
                    Travel Documents and Health Precautions:
                    <ul>
                  <li>  Make sure you have all necessary travel documents such as passports, visas, and ID cards. Also, check if you need new vaccines or other health precautions like travel insurance. Make copies of important documents and store them separately and safely.</li>
                  </ul>
